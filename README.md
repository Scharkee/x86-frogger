# x86-frogger

A project for the Computer Organization course(CSE1400) at Delft University of Technology.

## Requirements

To build , you need to ensure you are using a Linux distribution on a x86-64 architecture (i.e., 64-bit Linux on any modern Intel/AMD processor) with a recent version of GNU binutils to compile. In addition, you will need Qemu or Bochs (both emulators for a.o. the x86-64 platforrm).

## Getting started

To get started on developing your game, execute the following steps:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the gamelib-x64 folder.
3. Execute `make` to compile gamelib-x64 against the default (empty) game.
4. Execute `make qemu` to launch the compiled game in the Qemu emulator.
